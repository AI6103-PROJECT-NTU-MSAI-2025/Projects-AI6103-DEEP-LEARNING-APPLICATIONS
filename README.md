## Project Topic:
<font color=gray>pending</font>

## Basic INFO about the project:

### 1. Scoring Criteria  
Project weighting: **40%** (Presentation:**10%**, report: **30%**)
>- Novelty and Difficulty ``(20 pts)``
>- Technical Approach: Correctness. Elegance. Good results. `` (10pts)  ``
>- Writing: Correct and idiomatic English. Clarity. Conciseness (as opposed to verbose and low information content per word)``  (10 pts)`` .

### 2. Suggested topic
**i. Reimplement / improve techniques in conference paper** (AAAI, IJCAI, ICML, NeurIPS, ICLR, CVPR, ICCV, ECCV, NAACL, ACL, EMNLP) 
>- Take a conference paper in 201X. Reimplement the algorithm in that paper. <font color=red>[No existing source code is allowed]</font>
>- Take a conference paper in 201X. Develop/implement an improvement on top of its existing code base. <font color=red>[Existing source code is allowed]</font>  

**ii. Analyze the differences between different techniques**
>- Take a dataset (e.g., CIFAR-10, Sentiment Analysis, etc.) and a popular network
(e.g., ResNet-18, Transformer), and experiment with 4-5 different regularization
techniques. Analyze the differences in the result created by these techniques. <font color=red>[Lower grade caused by Lower novelty and difficulty]</font>

### 3. Project DDLs
**Groupings for Final Project Due on <font color=red>8 Oct</font>**  
**Final project report and video due on <font color=red>24 Nov</font>**

###  Tips
1. It is recommended that everyone use the same version of Python and packages (especially pytorch)
2. (to be added...)
